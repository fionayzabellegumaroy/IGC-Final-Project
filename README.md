# IGC-Final-Project
__Intro to Computer Graphics Final Project:__
<br>Create a 3D maze using WebGL that incorporates custom textures, collision detection for navigation, and basic lighting. The player will navigate through the maze to find the exit (find a letter on the floor), with a win screen upon completion.

# Important to Note:
For now, this uses pointer lock controls, which means that you have to click/double click on to canvas to initiate movement. Escape to get out of pointer lock controls. If there is some bug with controls, refresh screen and that should reset the controls [hopefully :)].
