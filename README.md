# IGC-Final-Project
Intro to Computer Graphics Final Project: 
Create a 3D maze using WebGL that incorporates custom textures, collision detection for navigation, and basic lighting. 
The player will navigate through the maze to find the exit (for now is an orange block on the floor), with a win screen upon completion.
